Every file should be camel cased.
As well as making sure that no redundent features such as numbers
at the end of the file or "old version" are used.

If a scene requires one or multiple scripts they should be together
in the same folder. Making a "scene" and "scripts" misc.
folders is ok just make sure that if a specific
scene requires a specific script they should be kept together.
